## Overview

An Itential environment is composed of several applications working in conjunction with one another, including:

- Itential Automation Platform (IAP)
- Itential Automation Gateway (IAG)
- Redis
- RabbitMQ (when using IAP version 23.1 and older)
- MongoDB

In many environments, these applications are installed across multiple systems to improve resiliency and performance. To assist users with such installations, Itential provides the **Itential Deployer**.

The Itential deployer can deploy supported Itential architectures.

## Supported Architectures

- All-in-one Architecture
- Minimal Architecture
- Highly Available Architecture
- Active/Standby Architecture
- Blue Green Architecture

### All-in-one Architecture

The All-In-One architecture is an architecture where all components are installed on the same instance.  This architecture lends itself well to development environments and “throw away” environments like those found in a CI/CD pipeline.  Security considerations are non-existent or use simple default passwords as the emphasis is placed on simplicity.

### Minimal Architecture

A Minimal Architecture is an architecture where all or most components are single instances and can not gracefully tolerate failures. This architecture lends itself well to development environments. It favors the engineer with its simplicity and enables them to do their work with few restrictions. Security considerations should lean towards openness and ease of use but at the same time capture the spirit of the other higher environments. In this architecture, each of the required Itential components is a single instance.  This architecture will exercise the network connectivity between the components and can be advantageous to deploy as a development environment.

The ideal minimal architecture will have 5 VM's with each hosting a single instance of the required components. An acceptable variation is to have 1 VM with everything hosted on it. The number of VM's and what is hosted where is less of a concern with the MA because the intent is simplicity and to enable engineers to build automations and not be a highly-available environment.

Itential recommends applying security principles to ALL environments. In the MA, this would include configuring all components to use authentication. Optionally, we recommend using SSL when communicating with components on other VMs but recognize that this should be enabled at the discretion of the customer.

### Highly Available Architecture

A Highly Available Architecture is an architecture where all or most components are redundant and can gracefully tolerate at least 1 catastrophic failure. This architecture is the recommended architecture for testing environments and simple production environments. The intent is to provide an environment that is as close to production as possible so that testing automations can provide confidence and expose potential problems sooner in the development lifecycle. Security considerations should mimic production requirements. In this architecture, each of the required Itential components is installed in clusters to provide stability, mimic production, and expose any issues with the clustering of the components. This could also serve as a production architecture.

The ideal HA2 environment will have 12 VMs:

- 2 VMs hosting IAP.
- 3 VMs hosting MongoDB configured as a replica set.
- 3 VMs hosting Redis configured as a highly available replica set using Redis Sentinel.
- 3 VMs hosting Rabbitmq configured as a rabbit cluster (when installing IAP version 23.1 and older).
- 1 VM hosting IAG.

Itential recommends applying sound security principles to ALL environments. This would include configuring all components to use authentication within the HA2. Additionally, we recommend using SSL when communicating with components on other VMs and across clusters.

### Active/Standby Architecture

An Active/Standby Architecture (ASA) is an architecture (that is normally used for making HA2 architectures redundant) reserved for production environments where Disaster Recovery is required. It is not required that they be geographically redundant but they could be. The intent is to provide a standby environment that can be used in the event of a disaster on the active stack. The standby stack should be preconfigured to be quickly made into the active stack. Care needs to be taken that the same level of access to 3rd party systems existing in the standby stack matches those in the active stack. Security must be taken into account if this is used as a production environment.

The ideal ASA architecture will appear as two HA2 stacks except for MongoDB. One or more of the MongoDB instances must be hosted in the standby location as a replica of the primary. Ideally, the MongoDB cluster will consist of 5 members: 4 data-bearing members and a MongoDB arbiter. This will allow for a cluster of three mongos in the worst-case disaster scenario.

Itential recommends applying sound security principles to ALL environments. In the ASA, this would include configuring all components to use authentication and use SSL when communicating with components on other VMs and across clusters.

### Alternative Architectures

Its not unusual to "outsource" the management of the dependencies (Redis, RabbitMQ, MongoDB) to either other internal teams or to external vendors such as AWS. Itential provides a way to leverage these solutions simply by configuring them accordingly and as long as these solutions comply with the basic requirements. For example, if Elasticache is chosen to fulfill the Redis needs then it must use the "Redis" version and not "Memcache". Likewise for MongoDB, Mongo Atlas is supported but not DynamoDB which is not the same. See the examples for how to implement.

<!-- ### Blue/Green Architecture
This architecture requires two separate and complete Itential stacks. There is no constraint from a datacenter boundary, these stacks can exist in separate or the same datacenter. Control of the active environment is driven by the GTM load balancer. No configurations are shared between the stacks. No components are shared between the stacks. Any changes made to one will have zero impact on the other. The databases will need to be kept in sync so that when the inactive is made active it will have all the data. Switching from the active to inactive will require all users to login again.

This architecture is intended to reduce downtime as much as possible. It has the advantage of being two independent Itentials. Deployments and upgrades can be staged in advance during normal business hours against the inactive stack without impacting the active environment. Changes made on the blue stack will never effect the green. This includes code running adapters and applications, database documents such as workflows, and configurations. The actual deployment is when the load balancer is switched to the other stack. In flight jobs on the old stack will continue to run until they are complete. New jobs will start on the new stack using the new code, data models, and configurations.

The caveat to this architecture is that your job history is not immediately available after performing a switch. It is important to know which color ran the job as that is the stack that will have the job history. The stack that runs a job is where the history of that job will exist unless effort is made to reconcile the historical data. -->

## Deployer Prerequisites

The Itential Deployer is an Ansible project and as such requires running on a control node. That node has its own set of dependencies.

### Control Node Specifications
Itential recommends using a dedicated node running the requirements listed below as the ansible control node for the deployer project. That node should meet or exceed the following specifications:

| Component | Value                |
|-----------|----------------------|
| OS        | RHEL8/9 or Rocky 8/9 |
| RAM       | 4 GB                 |
| CPUs      | 2                    |
| Disk      | 20 GB                |

### Required Python, Ansible, and Ansible modules

- **Itential Galaxy Access**: The Itential Deployer is hosted on the Itential Galaxy repository. An account is required to access Itential Galaxy. If you do not have an account, contact your Itential Professional Services representative.
- **Python Version**: The control node must be running Python 3.9 or later.
- **Required Python Modules**: The following Python modules are required on the **Ansible Control Node** for the deployer to run.
  - jmespath
- **Ansible Version**: The control node must be running Ansible version 2.11 or later. To see which Ansible version is currently installed, execute the `ansible --version` command as shown below.

  _Example: Confirming Ansible Version_

  ```bash
  $ ansible --version
    ansible [core 2.12.2]
    config file = None
    configured module search path = ['/var/home/yourname/.ansible/plugins/modules', '/usr/share/ansible/plugins/modules']
    ansible python module location = /usr/local/lib/python3.9/site-packages/ansible
    ansible collection location = /var/home/yourname/.ansible/collections:/usr/share/ansible/collections
    executable location = /usr/local/bin/ansible
    python version = 3.9.9 (main, Nov 19 2021, 00:00:00) [GCC 11.2.1 20210728 (Red Hat 11.2.1-1)]
    jinja version = 3.0.3
    libyaml = True
  ```
- **Required Ansible Modules**: The following ansible modules are required on the control node for the deployer to run.
  - 'ansible.posix': '>=0.0.1'
  - 'community.mongodb': '>=0.0.1'

**&#9432; Note:**
The Itential Deployer is an Ansible collection. As such, a familiarity with basic Ansible concepts is suggested before proceeding.

### Required Public Repositories

In general the Deployer will install packages using the standard YUM repositories on the target servers.  When packages are not available for the distribution, the Deployer will either install the required repository or download the packages.

* RabbitMQ ports are only required when installing IAP version 2023.1 and older

### Certificates

The itential deployer is not responsible for creating any SSL certificates that may be used to further tighten security in the Itential ecosystem. However, if these certificates are provided it can upload and configure the platform to use them. The table below describes the certificates that can be used and what their purpose is.

| Certificate | Description |
|---|---|
| IAP webserver | Enables HTTPS communications with the IAP webserver. |
| IAG webserver | Enables HTTPS communications with the IAG webserver. |
| MongoDB | Enables secure communications with the MongoDB server. Also used for intra-node mongo replication. |
| Redis | Enables secure communications with the Redis server. Also used for intra-node redis replication. |
| LDAP | Enables secure communications with LDAP server. |

### Passwords

The deployer will create several user accounts in the dependent systems. It uses default passwords in all cases and those passwords can be overridden with the defined ansible variables. To override these variables just define the variable in the deployer host file.

### Obtaining the Itential Binaries

#### SaaS Customers
The latest IAG whl file is available to download from hub.itential.io.

#### On prem customers
The IAP and IAG binary files are hosted on the Itential Nexus repository. An account is required to access Itential Nexus. If you do not have an account, contact your Itential Sales representative.

## Installing and Upgrading the Deployer

### Online Installation

The Itential Deployer can be installed via the `ansible-galaxy` utility.

On your control node, execute the following command to install the Itential Deployer:

    ```bash
    ansible-galaxy collection install itential.deployer
    ```

When a new version of the Deployer is available, you can upgrade using the following command:

```bash
ansible-galaxy collection install itential.deployer --upgrade
```

### Offline Installation

If your control node does not have Internet connectivity, the Itential Deployer and its dependencies can be downloaded via another system, copied to your control node, and installed manually.

**&#9432; Note:**
Some of the following collections may already be installed on your control node. To verify, use the `ansible-galaxy collection list` command.

1. Download the following collections from the provided links:

    - [Itential Deployer](https://galaxy.ansible.com/ui/repo/published/itential/deployer/)
    - [Community General](https://galaxy.ansible.com/ui/repo/published/community/general/)
    - [Community MongoDB](https://galaxy.ansible.com/ui/repo/published/community/mongodb/)
    - [Ansible POSIX](https://galaxy.ansible.com/ui/repo/published/ansible/posix/)

2. Copy the downloaded collections to your control node.
3. Install the collections using the following command:

    ```bash
    ansible-galaxy collection install <COLLECTION>.tar.gz
    ```

## Running the Deployer

Once you have have installed the Itential Deployer, run it to begin deploying Itential to your environment. This section details a basic deployment using required variables only.

### Confirm Requirements

Before running the deployer we must ensure the following:

- **Compatible OS**: Any managed nodes to be configured by the Itential Deployer must use an operating system that is compatible with the target version of IAP (and, if applicable, IAG). For more information, refer to the [Itential Dependencies] page.
- **Hostnames**: Any hostnames used by managed nodes must be DNS-resolvable.
- **Administrative Privileges**: The `ansible` user must have administrative privileges on managed nodes.
- **SSH Access**: The control node must have SSH connectivity to all managed nodes.
- **Additional CentOS 7 Requirements**: Ensure that Python `setuptools-2.0` is installed on any CentOS 7 managed nodes.

**&#9432; Note:**
Although the Itential Deployer can be used to configure nodes that use any supported operating system, it is optimized for RHEL 8 and 9.

### Determine the Working and Deployer Directories

The Itential Deployer will be installed into the user's collection directory.  Because the Deployer collection will be overwritten when it is upgraded, users should not store any inventory files, binaries or artifacts in the Deployer collection directory.  Instead, users should create a working directory to store those files.  

The working directory can be any directory on the control node and will be referred to as the `WORKING-DIR` in this guide.  

Determine what directory the Itential Deployer is installed to by using the `ansible-galaxy collection list` command. In the following example, the Deployer directory is `/Users/<USER>/.ansible/collections/ansible_collections/itential/deployer`.

_Example: Determining the Deployer Directory_

```bash
% ansible-galaxy collection list

# /Users/<USER>/.ansible/collections/ansible_collections
Collection        Version
----------------- -------
ansible.netcommon 4.1.0
ansible.posix     1.5.4
ansible.utils     2.9.0
arista.avd        3.8.2
arista.cvp        3.6.0
arista.eos        6.0.0
community.general 7.3.0
community.mongodb 1.6.1
itential.deployer 1.0.0
```

The Deployer directory will be referred to as the `DEPLOYER-DIR` in this guide.

### Create the Files and Inventories Directories

The files and inventories directories should be sub-directories of the working directory.  The files directory will contain the Itential binaries and artifacts.  The inventories directory will contain the hosts files.

```base
% cd <WORKING-DIR>
% mkdir files inventories
```

### Download Installation Artifacts

Download the IAP binary along with any desired IAP adapters (and, if applicable, the IAG binary) from the [Itential Nexus Repository] to local storage.

**&#9432; Note:**
If you are unsure which files should be downloaded for your environment, contact your Itential Professional Services representative.

### Copy Installation Artifacts into the Files Directory

Next, copy the files downloaded in the previous step to the `files` subdirectory.

_Example: Copying to the Files Directory_

```bash
cd <WORKING-DIR>/files
cp ~/Downloads/itential-premium_2023.1.1.linux.x86_64.bin .
cp ~/Downloads/automation_gateway-3.198.19+2023.1.0-py3-none-any.whl .
```

### Create a Symlink to the Files Directory

Navigate to the playbooks directory in the Deployer directory and create a symlink to the files directory in the working directory.

```bash
cd <DEPLOYER-DIR>/playbooks
ln -s <WORKING-DIR>/files .
```

### Create the Inventory File

Using a text editor, create an inventory file that defines your deployment environment. To do this, assign your managed nodes to the relevant groups according to what components you would like to install on them. In the following example:

- All required variables have been defined.
- The managed node `example1.host.com` has been assigned to all groups, with the **exception** of the `gateway` group. As such, all components **except** IAG will be installed on this node.
- The managed node `example2.host.com` has been assigned to the `gateway` group. As such, IAG will be installed on this node.

**&#9432; Note:**
Itential recommends that all inventories follow the best practices outlined in the [Ansible documentation][Ansible Best Practices].

_Example: Creating the Inventory File_

```bash
cd <WORKING-DIR>
mkdir -p inventories/dev
vi inventories/dev/hosts
```

</br>

_Example: Inventory File (YAML Format)_

**&#9432; Note:**
There will not be a `rabbitmq` group or variables when installing IAP version 2023.2 and newer.

```yaml
all:
  vars:
    iap_release: 2023.1

  children:
    redis:
        hosts:
            example1.host.com:

    rabbitmq:
        hosts:
            example1.host.com:

    mongodb:
        hosts:
            example1.host.com:

    platform:
        hosts:
            example1.host.com:
        vars:
            iap_bin_file: itential-premium_2023.1.1.linux.x86_64.bin

    gateway:
        hosts:
            example2.host.com:
        vars:
            iag_release: 2023.1
            iag_whl_file: automation_gateway-3.227.0+2023.1.9-py3-none-any.whl
```

### Run the Itential Deployer

Navigate to the working directory and execute the following run command.

_Example: Running the Itential Deployer_

```bash
cd <WORKING-DIR>
ansible-playbook itential.deployer.site -i inventories/dev -v
```

### Confirm Successful Installation

After the Itential Deployer is finished running, perform the following checks on each component to confirm successful installation.

#### IAP and IAG

Use a web browser to navigate to the login page of your IAP/IAG servers. By default, it is located at `http://<hostname>:3000` or `http://<hostname>:8083`, respectively. If the IAP/IAG login page is displayed, the installation was successful.

If the login page is not displayed, check that the relevant service is running on the affected server using the `sudo systemctl status automation-platform` or `sudo systemctl status automation-gateway` command, respectively. The output should look similar to the following examples.

_Example Output: IAP System Status_

```bash
$ sudo systemctl status automation-platform

#### MongoDB, Redis, and RabbitMQ

From the command line of each dependency server, use the `sudo systemctl status <service>` command to confirm that the relevant service is running. When executing the command, replace `<service>` with one of the following:

- **MongoDB**: `mongod`
- **Redis**: `redis`
- **RabbitMQ**: `rabbitmq-server`

The output should look similar to the following examples.

_Example Output: MongoDB Status_

## Sample Inventories

Below are simplified sample host files that describe the basic configurations to produce the supported architectures. These are intended to be starting points only.

### All-in-one Architecture Inventory

Simple environment. IAP and all of its dependencies all on one host.

_Example: All-in-one Inventory File (YAML Format)_

**&#9432; Note:**
There will not be a `rabbitmq` group or variables when installing IAP version 2023.2 and newer.

```yaml
all:
  vars:
    iap_release: 2023.1

  children:
    redis:
        hosts:
            example1.host.com:

    rabbitmq:
        hosts:
            example1.host.com:

    mongodb:
        hosts:
            example1.host.com:

    platform:
        hosts:
            example1.host.com:
        vars:
            iap_bin_file: itential-premium_2023.1.1.linux.x86_64.bin

    gateway:
        hosts:
            example2.host.com:

            iag_whl_file: automation_gateway-3.227.0+2023.1.9-py3-none-any.whl
```

### Minimal Architecture Inventory

Similar to All-in-one but installs components on separate hosts.

_Example: Minimal Architecture Inventory File (YAML Format)_

**&#9432; Note:**
There will not be a `rabbitmq` group or variables when installing IAP version 2023.2 and newer.

```yaml
all:

  children:
    redis:
        hosts:
            redis.host.com:

<!-- ### Available tags
The ansible execution can be more finely controled by using the builtin ansible tags. The below table defines the available tags and describes what they can do. -->

## Component Guides

In addition to the `itential.deployer.site` playbook, there are playbooks for each component.

Each component installed by the Itential Deployer can be granularly configured by defining additional variables in the relevant inventory file. These additional playbooks, roles and their corresponding variables are detailed in the following guides.

### MongoDB

[MongoDB Guide](docs/mongodb_guide.md)

### Redis

[Redis Guide](docs/redis_guide.md)

### RabbitMQ

**&#9432; Note:**
Valid only when installing IAP version 2023.1 and older.

[RabbitMQ Guide](docs/rabbitmq_guide.md)

### Hashicorp Vault

[Hashicorp Vault Guide](docs/vault_guide.md)

### IAP

[IAP Guide](docs/iap_guide.md)

### IAG

[IAG Guide](docs/iag_guide.md)

## Patching IAP and IAG

The Deployer supports patching IAP and IAG.  Refer to the following guide for instructions on running the patch playbooks.

[Patch IAP Guide](docs/patch_iap_guide.md)

[Patch IAG Guide](docs/patch_iag_guide.md)

## Using Internal YUM Repositories

By default the Deployer will install YUM repositories which point to external URLs.  If the customer hosts repositories internally, the Deployer can be configured to skip installing the repositories.

**&#9432; Note:**
The customer will be reposible for configuring the repo files in `/etc/yum.repos.d`.

To use internal repositories, set `install_yum_repos` to `false` in the `all` vars section.  For example:

```yaml
all:
    vars:
        install_yum_repos: false
```

## Running the Deployer in Offline Mode

The Deployer supports installations in air-gapped environments.  Refer to the following guide for instructions on running the Deployer in offline mode.

[Offline Installation Guide](docs/offline_install_guide.md)

## Appendix A: Definition of "Highly Available" Dependencies

### Highly Available MongoDB

MongoDB clusters operate a primary/secondary model where data written to the primary will replicate to the secondary. There is much literature on the internet about Mongo clusters. That will not be covered here. However, it's important to note that Itential’s preferred MongoDB cluster will assume the following requirements:

- Authentication between the replica members done with either a shared key or X.509 certificate.
- The database will have an admin user able to perform any operation.
- The database will have an “itential” user that is granted the least amount of privileges required by the application.

Initial passwords are intended to be changed.

### Highly Available Redis

Redis clusters operate a primary/secondary model where data written to the primary will replicate to the secondary. There is much literature on the internet about Redis clusters. That will not be covered here. However, it's important to note that Itential’s preferred Redis cluster will assume the following requirements:

- Authentication between the replica members is done with users defined in the Redis config file.
- Redis will have an admin user able to perform any operation.
- Redis will have an “itential” user that is granted the least amount of privileges required by the application.
- Redis will have a replication user that is granted the least amount of privileges required by the replication process.
- Initial passwords are intended to be changed.
- Redis Sentinel will be included to monitor the Redis cluster and will be colocated with Redis.
- Redis Sentinel will have an admin user able to perform a Sentinel task.
- Redis nodes maintain a low latency connection between nodes to avoid replication failures.

### Highly Available Rabbitmq

Rabbitmq clusters operate independently of one another but they do require knowledge of one another. There is much literature on the internet about Rabbitmq clusters. That will not be covered here. However, it's important to note that Itential’s preferred Rabbitmq cluster will assume the following requirements:

- Rabbitmq nodes depend on DNS resolution. Itential will be using host files to accomplish this.
- Rabbitmq will have an admin user able to perform any operation.
- Rabbitmq will have an “itential” user that is granted the least amount of privileges required by the application.

Rabbitmq nodes maintain a low latency connection between nodes to avoid replication failures.
