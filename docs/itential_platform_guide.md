# Overview

The playbook and roles in this section install and configure Itential Platform.  There are currently two roles:

* `platform` – Installs Itential Platform and performs a base configuration.
* `platform_app_artifact` – Installs App Artifacts.

# Roles

## Platform Role

The `platform` role performs a base install of Itential Platform including any OS packages required. It includes the appropriate version of Python, Pip, Jinja, and TextFSM. It handles a few security vulnerabilities. It creates the appropriate Linux users, directories, log files, and systemd services. It will start the automation-platform service when complete.

When there is a device configured in the `gateway` group this role will also install and configure an IAG adapter that points to the gateway server(s) named in the `gateway` group.

## Platform Adapters Role

The `platform_adapters` role will install the source code for each adapter that is listed.  It will also install any listed custom adapters.  It can install from a Git URL or using an adapter archive generated by Adapter Builder.  It will restart the automation-platform service when complete.

## Platform App Artifact Role

The `platform_app_artifact` role will install app-artifacts, which is an optional Itential application that is primarily used only in development environments for packaging use cases together for deployment. It will restart the automation-platform service when complete.

# Variables

## Static Variables

The variables located in the `vars` directory of each role are "static" and not meant to be overridden by the user.  Since these variable files are included at run-time based on the Itential Platform release and OS major version, they have a higher precedence than the variables in the inventory and are not easily overridden.

## Global Variables

The variables in this section are configured in the inventory in the `all` group vars.

| Variable | Group | Type | Description | Default Value | Required?
| :------- | :---- | :--- | :---------- | :------------ | :--------
| `platform_release` | `all` | Fixed-point | Designates the Itential Platform major version. | N/A | Yes
| `mongo_root_ca_file_source` | `all` | String | The name of the MongoDB Root CA file.| N/A | No

The `platform_release` must be defined in the inventory.  This variable, along with the OS major version, is used to determine the static variables.

## Common Variables

The variables in this section may be overridden in the inventory in the `all` group vars.

The following table lists the default variables that are shared between the Platform-related roles, located in `roles/common_vars/defaults/main/platform.yml`.

| Variable | Group | Type | Description | Default Value
| :------- | :---- | :--- | :---------- | :------------
| `itential_root_ca_file_destination` | `all` | String | The location of the Root CA file for MongoDB. | `/opt/itential/keys/mongo-rootCA.pem`

## Platform Role Variables

The variables in this section may be overridden in the inventory in the `platform` group vars.

# Building the Inventory

To install and configure Itential Platform, add a `platform` group and host(s) to your inventory and configure the `platform_release` and either `platform_bin_file`, `platfrom_tar_file`, or `platform_archive_download_url`. The `platform_archive_download_url` supports Sonatype Nexus and JFrog Artifactory. It is recommended to use `repository_username` and `repository_password` for Nexus and `repository_api_key` for Artifactory.  The following inventory shows a basic Itential Platform configuration with a single node.

## Example Inventory - Single Itential Platform Node

```
all:
    vars:
        platform_release: 2023.1

    children:
        platform:
            hosts:
                <host1>:
                    ansible_host: <addr1>
            vars:
                platform_bin_file: <bin-file>
```

To install Itential adapters, add the `platform_adapters` flag to the `platform` group and set it to `true`, and configure the adapters in the `platform_itential_adapters` variable.  You may also need to configure the `platform_delete_package_lock_file`, `platform_disable_git_safe_repo_checks` and `platform_npm_ignore_scripts` flags and set them to `true`.

## Example Inventory - Install Adapters

```
all:
    vars:
        platform_release: 2023.1

    children:
        platform:
            hosts:
                <host1>:
                    ansible_host: <addr1>
            vars:
                platform_bin_file: <bin-file>
                platform_adapters: true
                platform_itential_adapters:
                    - <git_repo1>
                    - <git_repoN>
                    - <zip_archive1>
                    - <zip_archiveN>
                platform_custom_adapters:
                    - <git_repo1>
                    - <git_repoN>
                    - <zip_archive1>
                    - <zip_archiveN>
                platform_custom_location: <location>
                platform_delete_package_lock_file: true
                platform_disable_git_safe_repo_checks: true
                platform_npm_ignore_scripts: true
```

To install App-Artifacts, add the `platform_app_artifact` flag to the `platform` group and set it to `true` and configure the `platform_app_artifact_source_file`.

## Example Inventory - Install App-Artifact

```
all:
    vars:
        platform_release: 2023.1

    children:
        platform:
            hosts:
                <host1>:
                    ansible_host: <addr1>
            vars:
                platform_bin_file: <bin-file>
                platform_app_artifact: true
                platform_app_artifact_source_file: <archive1>
```

## Example Inventory - Use Hashicorp Vault

```
all:
    vars:
        platform_release: 2023.1

    children:
        platform:
            hosts:
                <host1>:
                    ansible_host: <addr1>
            vars:
                platform_configure_vault: true
```

# Running the Playbook

To execute all Platform roles, run the `platform` playbook:

```
ansible-playbook itential.deployer.platform -i <inventory>
```

You can also run select platform roles by using the following tags:

* `platform_install`
* `platform_adapters`
* `platform_app_artifact`

To execute only the `platform` role, run the `itential.deployer.platform` playbook with the `platform_install` tag:

```
ansible-playbook itential.deployer.platform -i <inventory> --tags platform_install
```

To execute only the `platform_adapters` role, run the `itential.deployer.platform` playbook with the `platform_adapters` tag:

```
ansible-playbook itential.deployer.platform -i <inventory> --tags platform_adapters
```

To execute only the `platform_app_artifact` role, run the `itential.deployer.platform` playbook with the `platform_app_artifact` tag:

```
ansible-playbook itential.deployer.platform -i <inventory> --tags platform_app_artifact
```
