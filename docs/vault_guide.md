# Overview

The playbook and role in this section install and configure Hashicorp Vault for the Itential Automation Platform.  There is currently one Vault-related role:

* `vault` – Installs Hashicorp Vault, performs a base configuration, and unseals the Vault.

# Roles

## Vault Role

The `vault` role performs a base install of Hashicorp Vault including any OS packages required. It creates the appropriate Linux users, groups, configuration files, and directories for the service to run. It will start the vault service when complete.  It will then perform the steps required to setup the Vault server. Steps include initializing the server, unsealing the server, generating the root key for the server, and enabling the KV secrets engine used to store Itential Platform secrets. 

# Variables

## Static Variables

The variables located in the `vars` directory of each role are "static" and not meant to be overridden by the user.  Since these variable files are included at run-time based on the Itential Platform release and OS major version, they have a higher precedence than the variables in the inventory and are not easily overridden.

## Common Variables

The variables in this section may be overridden in the inventory in the `all` group vars.

The following table lists the default variables that are shared between the Vault-related roles, located in `roles/common/defaults/main/vault.yml`.

| Variable | Group | Type | Description | Default Value
| :------- | :---- | :--- | :---------- | :------------
| `vault_port` | `all` | Integer | The Vault listen port. | `8200`
| `vault_root_key_dir` | `all` | String | The Vault root key directory. | `/opt/vault/keys/root_key`
| `vault_name` | `all` | String | The name of the secret engine used to configure vault and Itential Platform | `itential`
| `vault_read_only` | `all` | Boolean | Flag to manage how secret data is written to Vault with Itential Platform version 2021.2 and later. | `true`

Beginning with the 2021.2 release, a `readOnly` property was added to vaultProps in the properties.json file. This property allows developers to denote fields that contain sensitive data and manage how secret data is written to Vault. This configurable property defaults to false.

When set as readOnly: true, the following will occur:

 - Masking in the UI will be disabled (turned off).
 - Clear text will be shown.
 - All custom user decorations will be ignored.
 - Itential Platform will not write data to Vault.

⚠ WARNING: If there are passwords stored within Vault and the readOnly property is initially set to false, and then later changed to true, all passwords will be lost and have to be set manually.

## Vault Role Variables

The variables in this section may be overridden in the inventory in the `vault` group vars.

The following table lists the default variables located in `roles/vault/defaults/main.yml`.

| Variable | Group | Type | Description | Default Value
| :------- | :---- | :--- | :---------- | :------------
| `vault_dir` | `vault` | String | The Vault data directory. | `/opt/vault`
| `vault_cluster_port` | `vault` | Integer | The Vault cluster communication port. | `8201`
| `vault_user` | `vault` | String |The Vault Linux user. | `vault`
| `vault_group` | `vault` | String | The Vault Linux group. | `vault`
| `vault_unseal_keys_dir` | `vault` | String | The Vault unseal keys directory. | `/opt/vault/keys/unseal_keys`

# Building Your Inventory

To install and unseal Vault, add a `vault` group and host to your inventory.  The following inventory shows a basic Vault configuration with a single Vault node.

## Example Inventory - Single Vault Node

```
all:
    children:
        vault:
            hosts:
                <host1>:
                    ansible_host: <addr1>
```

**&#9432; Note:**
In order to use Vault in Itential Platform, the `platform_configure_vault` variable will need to be set in the `platform` group and the `itential.deployer.platform` playbook will need to be executed.  Refer to the [Itential Platform Guide](itential_platform_guide.md).

# Running the Playbook

To execute the Vault role, run the `vault` playbook:

```
ansible-playbook itential.deployer.vault -i <inventory>
```

You can also run select Vault tasks by using the following tags:

* `install_vault`
* `configure_vault`
* `unseal_vault`

To execute only the installation tasks, run the `itential.deployer.vault` playbook with the `install_vault` tag:

```
ansible-playbook itential.deployer.vault -i <inventory> --tags install_vault
```

To execute only the configuration tasks, run the `itential.deployer.vault` playbook with the `configure_vault` tag:

```
ansible-playbook itential.deployer.vault -i <inventory> --tags configure_vault
```

To execute only the unseal tasks, run the `itential.deployer.vault` playbook with the `unseal_vault` tag:

```
ansible-playbook itential.deployer.vault -i <inventory> --tags unseal_vault
```
