# Transparent Hugepages (THP) is a Linux memory management system that reduces the overhead
# of Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB) lookups. THP achieves this by combining small pages
# and making them appear as larger memory pages to the application.
#
# In MongoDB 8.0 and later, ensure that THP is enabled before mongod starts by creating a
# service file for your platform's initialization system.
#
# Additionally, for RHEL and CentOS systems that use ktune and tuned performance profiles,
# you must also create a custom tuned profile.
#
# Check if its already enabled
