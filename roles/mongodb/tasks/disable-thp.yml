# MongoDB 7 and below!
#
# Transparent Huge Pages (THP) is a Linux memory management system that reduces the overhead
# of Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB) lookups on machines with large amounts of memory by
# using larger memory pages.
#
# However, database workloads often perform poorly with THP enabled, because they tend to
# have sparse rather than contiguous memory access patterns. When running MongoDB on Linux,
# THP should be disabled for best performance.
#
# To ensure that THP is disabled before mongod starts, you should create a service file for
# your platform's initialization system that disables THP at boot. Instructions are provided
# below for both the systemd and the System V init initialization systems.

# Check if its already disabled
