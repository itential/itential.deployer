# Tune Kernel parameters

# If you experience network timeouts or socket errors in communication between clients and
# servers, or between members of a sharded cluster or replica set, check the TCP keepalive
# value for the affected systems.
#
# Many operating systems set this value to 7200 seconds (two hours) by default. For MongoDB,
# you will generally experience better results with a shorter keepalive value, on the order
# of 120 seconds (two minutes).
#
# If your MongoDB deployment experiences keepalive-related issues, you must alter the
# keepalive value on all affected systems. This includes all machines running mongod or
# mongos processes and all machines hosting client processes that connect to MongoDB.
