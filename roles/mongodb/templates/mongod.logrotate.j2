# -----------------------------------------------------
# This file is managed by Ansible.
# Safe to edit, but if you re-run automation, it may be overwritten.
#
# To customize retention, compression, or post-rotate actions, edit below.
# You can change values such as 'rotate', 'daily', or the 'create' directive
# as needed for your environment.

{{ mongodb_log_dir }}/mongod.log {
    # How often to rotate (change to weekly/monthly if desired)
    daily

    # How many rotations to keep (increase/decrease as needed)
    rotate 7

    # Enable compression for old logs (can comment to disable)
    compress
    delaycompress

    # Don't complain if log is missing or empty
    missingok
    notifempty

    # File permissions & ownership for new logs
    create 0640 {{ mongodb_owner }} {{ mongodb_group }}

    # Ensures only one rotation at a time if multiple logs exist
    sharedscripts

    # What to do after rotation (do not remove HUP unless you know what you are doing)
    postrotate
        /bin/systemctl kill -s HUP mongod.service >/dev/null 2>&1 || true
    endscript
}
