# Inter-node connections use a buffer for data pending to be sent. Temporary throttling on
# inter-node traffic is applied when the buffer is at max allowed capacity. The limit is
# controlled via the RABBITMQ_DISTRIBUTION_BUFFER_SIZE environment variable in kilobytes.
# Default value is 128 MB (128000 kB).
#
# In clusters with heavy inter-node traffic increasing this value may have a positive effect
# on throughput. Values lower than 64 MB are not recommended.
# rabbitmq_distribution_buffer_size: 128000

# The largest allowed message payload size in bytes. Messages of larger size will be
# rejected with a suitable channel exception. Default: 134217728, Max value: 536870912

# Makes it possible to override the total amount of memory available, as opposed to
# inferring it from the environment using OS-specific means. This should only be used
# when actual maximum amount of RAM available to the node doesn't match the value
# that will be inferred by the node, e.g. due to containerization or similar
# constraints the node cannot be aware of. The value may be set to an integer number
# of bytes or, alternatively, in information units (e.g `8GB`). For example, when the
# value is set to 4 GB, the node will believe it is running on a machine with 4 GB of RAM.
# Default: undefined (not set or used).
