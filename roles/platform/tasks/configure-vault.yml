# TODO: Figure out how we want to handle the Vault token.
#       Do we want to continue to copy the the token from the Vault server?
#       Do we want to create a variable that contains the token?
#       Do we want to put the Vault token in the files directory and create a file variable?

    path: "{{ platform_vault_token_dir }}"
    state: directory

    src: '{{ vault_root_key_dir }}/token.txt'
